Test Plan

Test basic normal use cases

   - start server console
   - start client gui
   - plant field with wheat using client gui, wait 1 hour
   - get field info using client gui
     - verify height of wheat ~60 cm +-3%
   - harvest wheat field using client gui
   - get field info using client gui
     - verify there is no crop in the field now
   - plant field with corn using client gui, wait 1 hour
   - get field info using client gui
     - verify height of corn ~120 cm +- 3% 
   - harvest corn field using client gui
   - get field info using client gui
     - verify there is no crop in the field now
   - plant field with soybean using client gui, wait 1 hour

     - verify there is no crop in the field now
  
Test basic perfomance
  - plant crops on 50 fields
    - verify 50 various crops can be planted
    - verify each field has a unique string name
    - verify you can get information for all fields
  - wait a 10 minutes
    -verify the various crops have grown within +-3% of expected height
  - harvest crops on a few random fields
    - verify 
  - change code to 50,000,000 fields, verify response time still reasonable the same
  - run one server, multiple clients on different machines
    - verify both clients can communicate with the server
    - plant various crops on various fields using client 1
      - verify field information using client 1 
      - verfy field information using client 2
    - harvest crops using client 2
      - verify crops planted on client 1 can be harvested using client 2
      - verify field information using client 1
    - change or modify fields using client 2
      - verify field information on client 2
      - verify field information on client 1
    -repeat but reverse roles of client 1 and 2
      -verify all field information

Negative test

  - Don't run the server, try to communicate with server using client
    - verify error is handled
  - Plant crop on a field, attempt to plant a different crop on the field
    - verify no errors occur
  - Harvest an empty field
    - verify no errors occur
  - Enter bad field name
    - verify error is handled
  - Enter bad crop type
    -verify error is handled
